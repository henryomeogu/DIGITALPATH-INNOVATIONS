WINNING THE WEB: Optimising Engagement, Conversions & User Satisfaction with Data-Driven Insights! 

Over the past few days, I’ve been diving deep into 'DigitalPath Innovations' website performance, leveraging Tableau Public to analyse key engagement and conversion metrics. Through A/B testing, we uncovered powerful insights:
✅ Version A outperformed Version B, driving higher engagement (5 min avg. time spent vs. 3.3 min), more conversions (70.5% vs. 38.2%), and stronger user satisfaction (4.5/5 vs. 3.0/5).
✅ Version B showed promise in video engagement & search traffic but needed optimisation for retention and conversion.
✅ Strategic improvements in CTAs, checkout experience, and content flow can boost user engagement and sales.
This project reaffirmed the power of data-driven decision-making in digital marketing! Excited to keep optimising and refining strategies.
